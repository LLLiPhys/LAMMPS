To run the simulation, the following scripts will be involved:

- build.sh: create a graphene sheet using supercell approach

- in.lmp: line-by-line scripts to run the simulation

- run.sh: run simulation for different vacancy concentrations

- plot.py: plot the stress-strain relation of the graphene sheet
